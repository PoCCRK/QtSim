getting start:
./bin/QtSim.exe

extract *.zip in input dir to output dir:
Tools->Extract

new task to start your comparison:
File -> New
Set the input dir, set the SSim parameters.
Please be really careful to set temp and output dir, because Tools -> Clean will
delete everything in temp and output dir.

compute the text simlarity:
doTSim
The simliarest target project will be recorded. This function is supported by
sim_*.exe.

compute the structure simlartity:
doSSim
The simliarest target project will be recorded.

see detail of one project about TSim:
right-click on the project -> Detail
Note that you cannot see detail before TSim is done, because QtSim do not konw which
project should be compared to the project you choose. The program will remind you
about that when you right-click -> Detail, when the TSim is not compeleted.

exit: (this is the way I recommand to exit)
File -> Exit

to extact *.zip in a dir:
Tools -> Extract
Set the input and output dir, set the extract options (I recommad you to use
rename-new-files option). This function is supported by 7Zip.

It is possible that TSim and SSim will take a long time to run when inputs
are large in size or number, as well as occupiing a large space (memory).
Under that situation, if you click doTSim or doSSim or Detail or something else,
even including exiting the project. You will wait till the current step is done,
an then the next step will be processed. So it looks like a queue, even you chose to exit, as the GUI is invisiable then, it will be still keep working until the
current step is done.
