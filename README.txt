QtSim is developed under Qt, so it is under (L)GPLv3.
In that case, the use and copyright is under (L)GPLv3 too.
You can see the licenses of Qt in:
https://www1.qt.io/licensing/

Note that the QtSim is compiled by MSVC2017 64bit, so it works
under Windows OS 64bit.

I use external tools like 7Zip. Here are the website:
http://www.7-zip.org/
You can check the licenses in their website:

----MOST IMPORTANTLY----
The core of this program is sim. The website of sim:

A thousands thanks to Dick Grune.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You should be very CAREFUL to use the "Clean" in "Tools".
It is dangrous when you change the default directorys of temp and output, as it
will delete * -r in that 2 directorys. Unfortunately, they cannot be recovered.
You can imagine to delete * -r in c:\, espcailly in Windows OS, because we are
all admin in Windows OS.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Finally, I could write something I wanna say. Thanks to use my program. Since
it is still under test, and all developed by myself, it is normal to have
bugs and it is not that user-friendly.

I will keep on working on this project, and soon our input and output will be
linked to a DateBase.

The thing I hope to do most is to change the algorithm to compute SSim (as the
structure simlarity of file trees). Here is the algrithm I am going to learn
and use, and its license:
